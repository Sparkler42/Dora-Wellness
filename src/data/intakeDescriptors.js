  // ── BODY AREAS ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  "Lower back":
    "The lower back supports nearly everything you do \u2014 sitting, standing, walking, and lifting. Tension or pain here is one of the most common physical complaints. Spark\u2019s lower back practices focus on gentle release, spinal awareness, and building the supportive strength that reduces strain over time.",
  "Core":
    "Your core is the group of deep muscles surrounding your spine, abdomen, and pelvis \u2014 not just your abs. A strong, aware core supports your posture, protects your lower back, and helps you move with more ease and confidence. Many people have never been taught how to actually feel and activate these muscles.",
  "Hips & pelvis":
    "The hips are the body\u2019s center of gravity and carry enormous amounts of physical and even emotional tension. Tightness here can affect your back, knees, and overall mobility. Spark\u2019s hip practices work with both the joints and the surrounding muscles, including the often-overlooked pelvic floor.",
  "Shoulders":
    "The shoulders are a crossroads of stress, posture, and repetitive use. Whether from desk work, stress holding, old injuries, or overhead activity, shoulder tension is extremely common. Practices here address both the joint and the surrounding muscles \u2014 neck, upper back, and chest.",
  "Neck & jaw":
    "The neck and jaw are prime areas for unconscious stress holding. Many people clench their jaw, crane forward at screens, or hold chronic tension in the throat and base of skull without realizing it. These practices invite a deep release of patterns that often connect all the way down the spine.",
  "Knees":
    "The knees are complex joints that depend heavily on what\u2019s happening above and below them \u2014 hip alignment, foot placement, and quad and hamstring balance all affect knee health. Spark\u2019s knee-focused practices address flexibility, stability, and the awareness that protects joints during daily movement. Relevant for those with pain, past injuries, replacements, or simply stiff knees.",
  "Feet & ankles":
    "Your feet are your foundation \u2014 and most people barely pay attention to them. Foot and ankle awareness affects your balance, posture, and how efficiently you move through the world. These practices are especially relevant if you have flat feet, high arches, plantar fasciitis history, or simply spend a lot of time on your feet.",
  "Whole body":
    "You\u2019re interested in practices that work the whole system rather than isolating specific areas. This is a great choice if you want balance, general mobility, or simply aren\u2019t sure where to focus yet.",
  "Nothing specific":
    "You don\u2019t have a particular area calling for attention right now \u2014 and that\u2019s perfectly fine. Spark will offer well-rounded practices that support your whole body.",

  // ── GOALS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
  "Reduce pain or tension":
    "You\u2019re looking to release something that\u2019s been held \u2014 physical tightness, chronic tension, or persistent discomfort. Spark approaches pain not as something to fight but as information from your body. These practices help you listen, release, and build conditions for lasting ease.",
  "Build strength":
    "Not gym strength \u2014 body awareness strength. The kind that comes from knowing how to engage the right muscles, move from your core, and build stability that supports everything you do. Spark\u2019s strength practices are grounded in somatic intelligence, not just repetition.",
  "Improve flexibility":
    "Flexibility is about more than being able to touch your toes. It\u2019s about ease of movement, range of motion, and releasing the chronic holding patterns that limit how you feel in your body day to day.",
  "Stress relief":
    "The body holds stress whether or not the mind is aware of it. These practices work with the nervous system directly \u2014 using breath, movement, and attention to shift out of fight-or-flight and into genuine rest and recovery.",
  "Better sleep":
    "Sleep quality is deeply connected to what the nervous system does in the hours before bed. These practices help you transition \u2014 releasing the day\u2019s physical and mental accumulation so your body can actually rest.",
  "Mental clarity":
    "Attention is a trainable skill, and a clearer mind often starts with a more settled body. These practices work the mind-body connection directly, helping you think more clearly by first helping you feel more grounded.",
  "Body connection":
    "Many people live mostly in their heads, experiencing the body only when it hurts or demands attention. These practices invite a different relationship \u2014 one of curiosity, presence, and genuine listening to what your body is communicating.",
  "Fun & play":
    "Movement doesn\u2019t have to be serious to be beneficial. These practices are about rediscovering the joy of being in a body \u2014 lightness, spontaneity, and the kind of physical delight that gets squeezed out of adult life.",
  "Self-discovery":
    "Wellness as a journey inward. These practices use movement, breath, and attention as tools for understanding yourself more deeply \u2014 your patterns, your habits, and your capacity for change.",

  // ── MIND INTEREST ───────────────────────────────────────────
  "Meditation":
    "Spark\u2019s meditation practices aren\u2019t about emptying your mind \u2014 they\u2019re about developing a different relationship with your thoughts and sensations. Even a few minutes of intentional stillness can meaningfully shift how you feel and respond throughout the day.",
  "Attention training":
    "Attention is the master skill underlying all of Spark\u2019s work. These practices train your ability to notice \u2014 where your mind goes, what your body feels, and how you can redirect your focus with intention. Think of it as fitness for your awareness itself.",
  "Sensory awareness":
    "We take in far more sensory information than we consciously process. These practices slow things down and invite you to actually notice what you\u2019re seeing, hearing, and feeling \u2014 building a richer, more present experience of being alive.",
  "Memory & cognition":
    "Memory practices in Spark use visualization and mental recall as tools for grounding and self-awareness. They\u2019re not about memorization \u2014 they\u2019re about strengthening the quality of your inner attention and the vividness of your mental life.",
  "Self-reflection":
    "These practices invite honest, curious inquiry into your own patterns \u2014 physical habits, emotional responses, and the automatic behaviors that shape your days. Self-awareness is the foundation of any lasting change.",
  "Imagination":
    "Imagination practices use your mind\u2019s eye as a wellness tool. Visualization, creative mental exploration, and guided imagery can shift your nervous system, reduce pain, and expand your sense of what\u2019s possible in your body and your life. No artistic ability required.",

  // ── EXPERIENCE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  "Brand new \u2014 I'm curious":
    "You\u2019re just starting to explore intentional movement or wellness practices. Welcome \u2014 this is the best place to start. Spark will meet you exactly where you are, with no assumptions and no judgment. Everything is designed to be accessible.",
  "Some yoga or stretching":
    "You\u2019ve done some exploring \u2014 maybe a yoga class, some stretching, or occasional wellness practices. You have a basic sense of your body and are ready to go a little deeper. Spark will build on what you already know.",
  "Regular mover":
    "Movement is already part of your life, whether that\u2019s gym work, yoga, running, or another practice. You\u2019re ready for practices that add depth, nuance, and body intelligence to what you already do.",
  "Advanced \u2014 years of practice":
    "You have significant experience with movement, body practices, or somatic work. Spark\u2019s advanced practices will challenge your attention and awareness even if the movements themselves feel familiar. The depth is in the quality of presence, not just the difficulty.",

  // ── TIME AVAILABLE ──────────────────────────────────────────
  "5\u201310 minutes":
    "Short practices are not lesser practices. Five intentional minutes can shift your entire day. These practices are designed to be complete in themselves \u2014 not abbreviated versions of longer ones.",
  "15\u201320 minutes":
    "A sweet spot for building a consistent practice. Long enough to go somewhere real, short enough to fit into most days without negotiation.",
  "30\u201345 minutes":
    "When you have the time and the inclination to go deep. These longer practices allow for a fuller arc \u2014 warmup, exploration, integration.",
  "60+ minutes":
    "For those who want the full immersion. An hour or more allows you to truly settle in, explore multiple dimensions of practice, and experience the kind of deep shift that shorter sessions can only hint at.",

  // ── TIME OF DAY ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  "Early morning":
    "Morning practices set the tone for your entire day \u2014 they\u2019re an investment in how you\u2019ll feel and function for the next 16 hours.",
  "Mid-morning":
    "Mid-morning is a window of natural alertness. Practices here can deepen your focus and carry momentum through the rest of your day.",
  "Afternoon":
    "Afternoon is an underused window. A brief practice can break the energy slump, reset your nervous system, and carry you through the rest of your day.",
  "Evening":
    "Evening practices help you transition from doing to being \u2014 releasing the day\u2019s accumulation and preparing your body and mind for genuine rest.",
  "Varies":
    "Your schedule is flexible or unpredictable. Spark will offer practices appropriate to whatever time of day you open the app.",

  // ── NOTIFICATIONS ───────────────────────────────────────────
  "Very gently \u2014 minimal":
    "Spark will check in rarely, only for things that really matter. Your space is your own.",
  "Balanced \u2014 a few daily":
    "A light, supportive presence. Spark will offer reminders and suggestions a few times a day without overwhelming you.",
  "Actively \u2014 keep me on track":
    "You want accountability. Spark will be more proactive about reminders, nudges to complete your practice, and check-ins on your progress.",
  "I'll come on my own":
    "No notifications. You\u2019ll open Spark when you\u2019re ready, on your own terms.",

  // ── DEVICE WELLNESS ─────────────────────────────────────────
  "Yes, I'd love that":
    "Spark will gently observe your device usage patterns and suggest wellness alternatives when you\u2019ve been scrolling for a while. Think of it as a friendly tap on the shoulder.",
  "Maybe later":
    "No problem \u2014 you can always enable this from your profile settings when you\u2019re ready.",
  "No thanks":
    "Spark won\u2019t observe your device patterns. You\u2019re in full control of when and how you engage with your practice.",
